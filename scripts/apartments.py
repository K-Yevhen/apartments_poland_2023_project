### Summary of Findings
The chart shows that **older buildings** in Krakow tend to be **more expensive**.
This is because they are often located **closer to the city center** and are known
as **"Kamienice"** in Polish. These historic buildings are valued for their **prime locations**,
**classic architecture**, and cultural significance, which makes them highly desirable despite their age.
